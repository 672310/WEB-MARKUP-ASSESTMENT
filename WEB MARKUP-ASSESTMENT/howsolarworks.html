	<h3>Article 1 - Solar panels </h3>
	<p>Solar panels are devices that convert light into electricity.<br>
	They are called "solar" panels because most of the time, the most<br>
	powerful source of light available is the Sun, called Sol by astronomers.<br>
	Some scientists call them photovoltaics which means "light-electricity."<br>
	A solar panel is a collection of solar cells. Lots of small solar cells<br> 
	spread over a large area can work together to provide enough power to<br>
	be useful. The more light that hits a cell, the more electricity<br>
	it produces, so spacecraft are usually designed with solar panels<br>
	that can always be pointed at the Sun even as the rest of the body<br>
	of the spacecraft moves around, much as a tank turret can be aimed <br>
	independently of where the tank is going.</p>

	<h3>Article 2 : Charge controller </h3>
	<p>A solar charge controller manages the power<br>
	going into the battery bank from the solar array.<br>
	It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not <br>
	overcharged during the day, and that the power <br>
	doesn’t run backwards to the solar panels overnight<br>
	and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are<br>
	available with additional capabilities, like lighting <br>
	and load control, but managing the power is its primary job.

	<h3>Article 3 :Battery system </h3>
	<p>A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use.<br>
	The solar battery extends the use of a PV-system’s generated<br>
	energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the<br>
	sun is not shining and the panels don’t produce energy.<br>
	Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity<br>
	is fed into the grid while also avoiding having to buy<br>
	expensive electricity from the grid later. Due to the increased<br>
	self-consumption, the electricity costs decrease significantly.<br>
	You will pay less per used kWh.</p>

<article class="Articles1-6" id="article4">
	<h3>Article 4 - DC power </h3>
	<p>The solar panels convert sunlight to DC
	(direct current) power,however your home
	uses AC (alternating current) power. So the
	inverter then converts the DC power into AC
	power to be used in your home.If you have 
	a solar battery, any excess solar power will
	then be used to charge your battery, storing
	the energy for use later on when the sun goes
	down.
<br>If you don’t have a battery (or if your battery
 is fully charged), your excess solar energy will 
 be exported to the electricity grid and your power
 company will pay you a feed-in tariff for that 
 electricity.</p>

	<h3>Article 5 : Inverter </h3>
	<p>A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type<br>
	of electrical converter which converts the <br> 
	variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic<br> 
	(PV) solar panel into a utility frequency<br> 
	alternating current (AC) that can be fed into<br> 
	a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, <br> 
	off-grid electrical network. It is a critical<br> 
	balance of system (BOS)–component in a <br> 
	photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary<br> 
	AC-powered equipment. Solar power inverters have <br> 
	special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic<br> 
	arrays, including maximum power point tracking<br> 
	and anti-islanding protection.</p>
</article>

<article class="Articles1-6" id="article6">
	<h3>Article 6 :AC power </h3>
	<p>Alternating current (AC) is the type of
	electric current generated by the vast majority
	of power plants and used by most power 
	distribution systems. Alternating current is 
	cheaper to generate and has fewer energy losses
	than direct current when transmitting electricity
	over long distances.[1] Although for very long 
	distances (more than 1000 km), direct current can
	often be better. As opposed to direct current,
	the direction and amperage of alternating current
	changes many times a second.</p>
